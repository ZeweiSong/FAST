This script will generate a new FAST style map file. This map file is similar to a Qiime style OTU map,
but also contains the information about sequences. It could be a map for either dereplicated seuqences,
or OTUs. If it is for OTUs, it can also contain information about the detail dereplicated unit within each
OTUs (abudnance and sequence)

Please feel free to contact me for any question.
